    "One factor in the incidence of violence could be the types of amenities that are found in an area. One might presume, for example, that areas with high concentrations of bars would have higher crime rates than areas without them, or that access to leisure centers might reduce crime by giving youth a healthy outlet. It might also be the case that criminality doesnâ€™t track linearly with any one type of venue, but rather certain combinations of venue types. \n",
